# Audio Deepfake Detection

## Overview
This repository is designed to generate synthetic (fake) audio using different codec methodologies and configurations. The goal is to create diverse deepfake audio samples to test the robustness of our deepfake detection model against state-of-the-art codec-generated deepfake audios.

## Features
- Generate fake audio using various codec models.
- Experiment with multiple configurations to assess the effectiveness of deepfake detection.
- Evaluate model robustness by testing against codec-based synthetic audios.

## Codecs Used
The repository utilizes advanced audio codecs, including:
- **AudioDec**: A state-of-the-art audio codec for compression and synthesis.
- **HiFiGAN**: A neural vocoder model for high-fidelity speech synthesis.
- **Descript Audio Codec**: A modern codec used for generating realistic synthetic speech.
- **Encodec**: A high-quality neural audio codec for efficient speech representation.
- **SpeechTokenizer**: A model for tokenizing speech representations used in synthetic speech generation.
- **Funcodec**: A powerful codec for functional and high-quality speech synthesis.
- Other experimental codecs for generating deepfake audio.


## Contribution
Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for improving the deepfake detection approach or integrating additional codec models, feel free to submit a pull request.
